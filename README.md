# FireEmblem2110

This is my homework assignment for Homework 8 for CS 2110 Summer 2020

This game follows the formula of Rock, Paper, Scissors but uses the traditional Fire Emblem Weapon Triangle (Axe, Sword, Lance)

## Buttons

- `Start` (Enter) - Used to Start up the game
- `Select` (Backspace) - Can be used at any time to reset the game back to the title screen
- `A` (z) - Used to select options when prompted
- `Left` (Left arrow) - Used to move the player left on the grid. Also used for changing menu options
- `Right` (Right arrow) - Used to move the player right on the grid. Also used for changing menu options
- `Up` (Up arrow) - Used to move the player up the grid
- `Down` (Down arrow) - Used to move the player down the grid

## Compile

Assuming all the neccessary programs have been installed, once inside the project folder, type `make med` in order to compile and launch using the Mednafen emulator.

This code all compiles to a native .gba file that can be run on other emulators if desired.

Use `make clean` to remove all compiled code

## Sprites and Attribution

All Fire Emblem sprites/templates have come from [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/fireemblemtheblazingblade/) and have been modified in some way for this project.
